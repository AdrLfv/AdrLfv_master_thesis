\section{Acknowledgements}

Writing this thesis has been an incredible experience in terms of self-introspection, mental power, and expansion of my horizons. I would like to thank the following people for following me and guiding my during this experience.

First, my P.I., Clément DUHART, for the invaluable advice that always proved insightful, and the strict but well-meaning pushes that encouraged me to grow and do better. My friend Thibault CHARLET, for introducing me to this incredible world of academia and being there with me every step of the way, with his advice en encouragement. Thomas JULDO, who trudged along with me on the path of creating our own platforms, and acted as an inspiration and a rival. Our banter, discussions, rock climbing and ice skating sessions together with Thibault and Alex DRU made these two years one of the most enjoyable experiences of my life despite the challenges. Johann and Wim for contributing to ALFRED and their very helpful feedback. I want to thank the DeVinci Innovation Center as a whole, for taking me in and giving me the means to grow and explore, and its people for their ever-present mental and technical support, the benevolent atmosphere and the inspiration of those who came before, with, and after me.

Finally, I would like to thank my parents Florence and Cédric, for sheltering me and giving me the resources to spend my studies without worry. For pushing me when I was lacking, and supporting me when I was down. I wouldn't be where I am and who I am without the tremendous efforts they put into my education and my well-being.
