\section{Acknowledgements}

I want to thank my supervisor, Dr. Clément DUHART, for guiding me throughout my projects and, more broadly, introducing me to the world of research and innovation by integrating me into the DVIC. The work environment of this space, combining self-improvement, knowledge sharing, and camaraderie, allowed me to flourish during these two wonderful years.

I thank Dr. Marc TEYSSIER for his valuable advice, particularly in electronics, and his feedback on my various projects. I also thank Dr. Xiao XIAO for her advice on writing this thesis, his supervision on my musical projects, and for sharing her passion for music.

I am grateful to Dr. Yliess HATI for introducing me to and sharing his passion for machine learning and computer graphics, Dr. Grégor JOUET for his valuable courses and software advice, and Ph.D. student Madalina NICOLAE for her friendship over these two years.

I thank Maxime BROUSSART for his shared collaboration, investment, and contributions to GOSAI. Our continuous sharing of new ideas for improving our respective platforms and rivalry have been a real source of inspiration and surpassing myself in my projects.

Finally, I can never thank doctoral student Thomas JULDO enough for his investment in my projects, for all his knowledge sharing, which allowed me to achieve what I do today, for sharing my passions in AI and Computer Graphics, for his mentorship, patience, and friendship during these two years.
